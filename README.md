### Introduction to My Digital Garden

Welcome to the beginning of my digital garden! This project is a personal knowledge management system where I cultivate and share my thoughts, ideas, and knowledge in a structured and visually appealing manner. It serves as a digital space for creativity and learning, built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js set up, you can run the development server using one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

After running the development server, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Inspiration and Credits

This digital garden project was inspired by and built upon several repositories that provided a solid foundation and inspiration. Here are the repositories that have been instrumental in starting this project:

- [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) by Tim Lrx: This repository served as a great starting point for integrating Tailwind CSS with Next.js and setting up a blog structure.
- [Velite](https://github.com/zce/velite) by Zce: Velite is a lightweight and fast development tool for Vue 3, which was adapted for use in this Next.js project.
- [Next.js Velite Blog Template](https://github.com/jolbol1/nextjs-velite-blog-template) by Jolbol1: This template provided a practical example of how to integrate Velite with Next.js, offering a solid foundation for building a blog.
